## Brief
An NMPC controlled small scale autonomous car driving around a road track with moving obstacles. The vehicle dynamics and reference generator were inspired and built upon details provided in [[1]](#references). 

An explanation of the theory and implementation of the simulation code is available in [NMPC part 1](https://am-press.github.io/posts/maths/nmpc-two-wheel-bicycle-model/) and [NMPC part 2](https://am-press.github.io/posts/maths/nmpc-two-wheel-bicycle-model/).
If you like the posts and want to build your own NMPC formulations, please check out [OpEn](https://alphaville.github.io/optimization-engine/). I thank my guide [Pantelis Sopasakis](https://github.com/alphaville) for his support in writing the articles and developing this code.

## Usage
1. Run the file `build_optimiser.py` to build the NMPC optimiser formulation.
2. Run the file `simulation.py` to simulate and visualise the NMPC controlled small scale car.

## File brief
1. `NMPC_moving_obstacles.gif` shows a sample simulation result.
2. `build_optimiser.py` contains code to build an NMPC optimiser using `OpEn`.
3. `dynamics.py` contains the bicycle model dynamics of a small scale car [[1]](#references).
4.  `track_generator.py` contains code to generate a road track and obstacle safety circles.
5. `reference_generator.py` contains code for generating position references for the NMPC controller and do **DOSA**.
6. `simulation.py` contains code to simulate the NMPC controlled vechile driving around a track with moving obstacles.
