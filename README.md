## Brief
An NMPC controlled small scale autonomous car driving around a road track with moving obstacles. The vehicle dynamics and reference generator were inspired and built upon details provided in [[1]](#references). 

An explanation of the theory and implementation of the simulation code is available in [NMPC part 1](https://am-press.github.io/posts/maths/nmpc-two-wheel-bicycle-model/) and [NMPC part 2 (coming soon)]().
If you like the posts and want to build your own NMPC formulations, please check out [OpEn](https://alphaville.github.io/optimization-engine/). I thank my guide [Pantelis Sopasakis](https://github.com/alphaville) for his support in writing the articles and developing this code.

## Usage
1. Run the file `build_optimiser.py` to build the NMPC optimiser formulation.
2. Run the file `simulation.py` to simulate and visualise the NMPC controlled small scale car.

## Results
The following GIFs showcase some of the simulation results presented in the [NMPC part 2](https://am-press.github.io/posts/maths/nmpc-two-wheel-bicycle-model/) article.

The vehicle starts at (-2,-2) and reaches (1, 6)." width="640" height="400">
</div>
The above GIF shows how the NMPC controller navigates the vehicle around an obstacle of $2$m radius (represented by blue circle) situated at the origin. The vehicle starts at $(-2, -2)$ and successfully reaches its destination $(1, 6)$ without hitting the obstacle.


The NMPC controller is then commanded to keep moving on an elliptical track in counter-clockwise direction, without exiting the track. The above GIF showcases the corresponding results.

</div>

We then add four static obstacles, represented with blue elliptical dotted regions, to the track and command the NMPC controller to navigate the vehicle on the track without hitting the obstacles. The below GIF shows the corresponding simulation results.

</div>
As it can be see from the above GIF, the vehicle successfully navigates around the track without hitting any obstacles.

To add realism to the simulation, we introduce the concept of a virtual sensor, due to which the obstacles only appear when they are within the range of the virtual sensor. The range of the virtual sensor starts from the point of center-of-gravity of the car till the red dot shown in the figure.

</div>

Finally, we introduce moving obstacles to the track and see how the NMPC controller performs. The below GIF shows the corresponding simulation results.

</div>
It is evident, from the above GIF, that the NMPC controller is successful in navigating the car around the track whilst avoiding multiple moving obstacles.
